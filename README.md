## Credits

This plugin uses sound materials from the [Moodist](https://github.com/remvze/moodist) project. To better adapt to the Obsidian environment, some sound materials have been modified:
- Removed some potentially anxiety-inducing sound effects (such as thunder)
- Removed several oversized audio files to reduce the plugin size
- Further compressed the audio, modified to variable bit rate, merged dual channels into joint stereo, and preserved only sounds between 40Hz ~ 15000Hz
- Removed base noise audio files, replacing them with dynamically generated noise
